# Extended Token Field

## Vaadin Add-On

The ExtTokenField add-on contains a field for managing tokens. The field is configurable in many ways. Each token is describable with one string and can execute custom actions. The field itself is no container. You must provide a ComboBox or a Button component to attach the ExtTokenField to a layout. Also, you can implement the Tokenizable interface in your bean or entity class to be able to set the fields value as a List of these objects.

Note: ExtTokenField means Extended Token Field, because there is another add-on called TokenField. It is only named this way to avoid confusion with the other add-on. It is developed completely from scratch.
